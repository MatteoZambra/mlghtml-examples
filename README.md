`mlght-ml` Practical Examples
===

This repository contains three example notebooks to illustrate the use and the features of the `mlght-ml` framework.

These notebooks give a non-complete overview of some common machine learning workflows.

Documentation is available at [the package page](https://github.com/MatteoZambra/mlghtml).

# Contents

1. [Example 1 ‒ Getting linear model unscaled parameters](./Example_1_-_LM_params.ipynb)
2. [Example 2 ‒ A real dataset example](./Example_2_-_Real_data.ipynb)
3. [Example 3 ‒ Comparing `mlght` and scikit-learn's `Pipeline`](./Example_3_-_mlghtml_and_Pipeline.ipynb)

# Aim and Scope
The `mlght-ml` framework has been developed as a personal tool to approach machine learning problems stemming from industrial case studies. The same design patterns have been identified in several projects. The natural move was to centralize these common patterns in one place.
